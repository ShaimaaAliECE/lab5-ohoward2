    Hello! Welcome to the Job Finder!! 
    <br></br>
    To find the categories mentioned in all the jobs and how many times each category was
    mentioned, type "localhost/jobCategories" in the url bar (without the quotes).
    <br></br>
    To find all the jobs with a given category (sent as a parameter), type: localhost/"insert category name". One example path that I used to test that it was working is: 
    localhost/python 
    <br></br>
    To find all jobs in a given city (sent in the querystring),  type: localhost/checkJobsInCity?cityName="insert city name". One example path that I used to test that is was working is:
    localhost/checkJobsInCity?cityName=New York
